# CS-360-Project

The Employee Attendance and Leave Management project aims to create an efficient system for tracking employee attendance and leave, addressing the need for automation and accuracy. Implementation of this system is intended to enhance productivity, reduce errors, and improve overall workforce management. The project will result in a user-friendly platform for employees to record attendance and request leaves while providing supervisors with advanced tools for monitoring attendance and generating reports. The project will require suitable hardware and software components, including servers with ample storage capacity and user-friendly applications compatible with standard operating systems and web browsers to achieve these goals. Specific requirements will be detailed in subsequent project documentation as it progresses.
